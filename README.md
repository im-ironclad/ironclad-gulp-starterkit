### Starter kit for whipping up a SCSS/VanillaJS project

Please feel free to utilize this yourself if you find it useful.  

This is best for quickly throwing together a playground to test things in Vanilla JS and PHP. If you end up using this for a full-fledged project then do a search for TODO: in the repo and i've left some notes for things you might want to set up off the bat. You would then mix this repo in with whatever project/framework you are working with.

1. This assumes you have a local environment set up, Fork & Clone the repo then point your vhost to /public.
2. Run **npm install** followed by **gulp build**
3. Point your browser to your configured ServeName and get to coding.
